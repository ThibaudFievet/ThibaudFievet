## Hello! Welcome to my Profile.

### I'm Thibaud Fievet, a student in a double diploma in Finance and Data analytics between Edhec Business School and Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)

> **I am passionate about understanding economic mechanisms and how data and algorithms can drive better decisions and performance. Thus, most of my project will be finance-oriented. Some of them are personnal project and some others are developped as school project. This GitHub profile serves as a professional portfolio of my work, a place where I apply my skills, document my learning journey, and showcase my abilities to potential recruiters and collaborators.**
